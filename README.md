## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Universitas Indonesia - Japan International Cooperation Agency (UI-JICA Project) for their generous support and funding for the development of our T-Guard SOC Package. It is really helpful in making this development becomes a reality. We are thankful for the opportunity to collaborate with UI and JICA especially for their trust in our vision. This development would not have been possible without their support.
